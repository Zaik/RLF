RLF - Reinforcement Learning Framework
Language: C++

State: Finished
Description:
Implements a base framework class that implements the basic Q-learning
algorithm, additionally implements an example reinforcement learning model
that uses the framework.

To use framework, you implement a model class that extends from
the framework, templated by what class you want to use for model
and state. The implemented model must provide:
A function that given a state provides what actions are available.
A function that given a state and an action, provides a new state and
an reward.
A function that provides a set of starting states.

The framework provides:
* Choosable parameters for greediness, learning rate, etc...
* The basic Q-learning algorithm
* Stores the current state and all q-values, so that a model can interface
  towards them
* Has a "run for X ticks" function
* Have a "run untill function X is true" function

Possible future extensions:
* Implement the SARSA algorithm as well

Deprecated extensions;
* Modes to choose wether to maximize or minimize reward
  (This can be done in implemented model by negative rewards)
